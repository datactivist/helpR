NEWS
- the chat is now asynchronous (and thus leave the R console available) (thx to @ColinFay)


TODO

- allow to share code and results easily (or screenshots)
- reprex
- share the environment
- see if using servr to serve the page and allow it to be modified on the fly can be useful
- addin to allow remote control of Rstudio?
- develop a knowledge base?
- check for identification of users => I think it can be done through https://docs.slaask.com/developers/javascript-sdk/gathering-information-visitors/ and registering the ID details in an .Rprofile (or .Renviron? not sure) file.
